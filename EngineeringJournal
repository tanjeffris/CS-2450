Im figuring out git!

1/28/25 The last two weeks have been incredibly stressful. Calc 2 and Physics have added a ton of pressure onto me, and one top of that, my wife and I
moved and got a puppy, which has been the main cause of my stress in a way. This is all on top of the feeling that I have no idea what I am doing in this class. 
I feel like I am starting so far behind, and even though I have time throughout my days to get help (for any of my classes), this puppy has me paranoid to 
leave him for more than an hour at a time. Anyways, I do appreciate the help and patience of profesor Compas, I feel like I will be relying on his office hours more 
than I ever have for any other class I've taken.
